# Project 4 - *MemoryGame*

Submitted by: **Sai Mannava**

**Memory Matching** is an app that tests memory by matching cards in sets of 2 being flipped.

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App loads to display a grid of cards initially placed face-down:
  - Upon launching the app, a grid of cards should be visible.
  - Cards are facedown to indicate the start of the game.
- [X] Users can tap cards to toggle their display between the back and the face: 
  - Tapping on a facedown card should flip it to reveal the front.
  - Tapping a second card that is not identical should flip both back down
- [X] When two matching cards are found, they both disappear from view:
  - Implement logic to check if two tapped cards match.
  - If they match, both cards should either disappear.
  - If they don't match, they should return to the facedown position.
- [X] User can reset the game and start a new game via a button:
  - Include a button that allows users to reset the game.
  - This button should shuffle the cards and reset any game-related state.
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] User can select number of pairs to play with (at least 2 unique values like 2 and 4).
  * (Hint: user Picker)

## Notes

It was difficult to get the cards to dissapear after their values matched but the logic for CardView worked after changing the indexes for cards.
